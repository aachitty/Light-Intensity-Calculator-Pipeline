Working Version: Fully Functioning Calculations

This commit represents the completed working version of the Haplon Light Intensity Calculator with all calculations functioning properly. Key improvements include:

1. Fixed intensity calculations for different modifier types
2. Added specialized handling for beam angle modifiers and diffusion types
3. Updated result display text to show "modifier" instead of "diffusion"
4. Implemented proper differentiation between different light models and their characteristics
5. Each light/modifier combination now returns appropriate and distinct values
6. Improved documentation with detailed README

The application now correctly calculates distance and intensity values based on the selected light model, modifier type, and color temperature, ensuring reliable results for professional cinematographers.
