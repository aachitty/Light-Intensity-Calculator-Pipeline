# 2D Visualizer Issues & Troubleshooting

## Current Status
The 2D visualizer feature is currently not rendering properly. The canvas appears to initialize correctly (as shown in the console logs), but no visual elements (grid, subject, or lights) are displayed.

## Console Log Analysis
The console logs show:

```
Initializing visualizer
initVisualizer called with lightData: {...}
Using fixed canvas dimensions: 600x400
Canvas initialized with size: 600x400
Visualizer initialized
```

Which suggests that the canvas is being set up correctly, but something is preventing the rendering of the visual elements.

## Attempted Fixes

### 1. Fixed Canvas Dimensions
We've updated the HTML to use fixed canvas dimensions instead of responsive ones:
```html
<canvas id="lighting-canvas" width="600" height="400" class="rounded" style="background-color: #222222; display: block; max-width: 100%;"></canvas>
```

### 2. Simplified Canvas Initialization
We've simplified the visualizer initialization code to use the dimensions directly from the canvas element rather than attempting to calculate them based on the container:
```javascript
// We're using the width and height set in the HTML
const width = canvas.width;
const height = canvas.height;
```

### 3. Modified Constructor
We've modified the LightingVisualizer constructor to no longer try to set the canvas dimensions programmatically:
```javascript
constructor(canvasId, width, height, lightData) {
    this.canvas = document.getElementById(canvasId);
    if (!this.canvas) {
        console.error(`Canvas element with id ${canvasId} not found`);
        return;
    }
    
    // We're using the width and height set in the HTML
    this.ctx = this.canvas.getContext('2d');
    this.lightData = lightData;
    
    console.log(`Canvas initialized with size: ${this.canvas.width}x${this.canvas.height}`);
}
```

## Potential Issues

1. **Canvas Rendering Context**: There might be an issue with obtaining the 2D rendering context.
2. **JavaScript Execution Order**: The draw functions might be called before the canvas is fully initialized.
3. **CSS Conflicts**: There could be CSS styles that are interfering with the canvas display.
4. **Tab Switching Logic**: The initialization on tab switch might not be working correctly.
5. **Browser Compatibility**: The canvas implementation might have browser-specific issues.

## Next Steps for Troubleshooting

1. **Add More Debug Logging**: Add console logs in the render method and draw functions to see if they're being called. ✅
2. **Simplify the Rendering**: Create a test function that just draws a single shape to verify basic rendering works. ✅
3. **Force Redraw**: Add a button that explicitly triggers a redraw to test if the issue is with automatic rendering. ✅
4. **Check Tab Switching**: Verify the tab switching logic is working correctly. ✅
5. **Inspect DOM**: Use browser tools to inspect the canvas element and ensure it's visible and properly sized. ✅

## Update: Enhanced Debugging Features (April 2, 2025)

We've implemented several troubleshooting enhancements to diagnose and fix the 2D visualizer rendering issues:

1. **Diagnostic Panel**: Added a dedicated diagnostics panel that reports on canvas initialization status, context availability, and rendering success.
2. **Force Render Test Button**: Implemented a button to manually force a canvas rendering test, which draws basic shapes to verify the canvas is working.
3. **Enhanced Error Reporting**: Improved error handling and reporting to provide more detailed information about initialization failures.
4. **Staged Initialization**: Modified the visualizer initialization process to perform incremental tests, verifying each step before proceeding.
5. **Visual Feedback**: Added visual feedback during initialization to confirm rendering is working properly.

These changes should help identify the precise cause of the rendering issues, particularly whether they are related to canvas initialization, context acquisition, or the rendering process itself.

## Implementation Notes

The 2D visualizer uses an object-oriented approach:

1. The `LightingVisualizer` class handles canvas management, event listeners, and rendering.
2. The `initVisualizer` function is called when the visualizer tab is shown.
3. The canvas draws:
   - A grid (representing 1-meter squares)
   - Distance rings (at 3m, 6m, 9m)
   - A subject (white circle in the center)
   - Lights (colored circles that can be dragged)

The visualizer also handles user interactions:
- Dragging lights to reposition them
- Selecting lights to view their properties
- Adding new lights via the "Add Light" button
- Removing selected lights via the "Remove Light" button

When a light is moved, it automatically recalculates the required intensity based on the new distance using an API call to the backend.
